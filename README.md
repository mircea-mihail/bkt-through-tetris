# bkt_through_tetris
  This code generates all the possible ways of filling
a tetris board with tetris tiles.

  There are two main libraries in this project, one
containing all of the printing functions and the other
one the basic utility ones.

  In the tetris.c file are: the main, backtracking and
indexing functions.
